The RCIC-26 is a motor-operated valve (MOV) and its normal position is closed.  The RClC-26 valve is redundant to the RCIC-25 valve, and is not the credited containment isolation valve.  The RCIC-26 valve has a safety function to be (manually) opened during certain event mitigation scenarios requiring a transfer of suction sources from the Condensate Storage Tank (CST) to the Torus.  "Based on the valve failing to fully close during MOV stroke time testing per PNPS Procedure 8.5.5.4, the RCIC system was declared inoperable at 0120 hours and the appropriate LCO was entered.  The RCIC-26 was subsequently returned to a full open position, caution tagged and the RCIC system was declared operable.  The LCO was exited at 0200 hours.  An investigation of the event is underway and continuing.  "This event had no impact on the health and/or safety of the public.  "The NRC Resident Inspector is on-site and has been notified.  "This is an 8-hour notification made in accordance with 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)."  The licensee will notify the State of Massachusetts.   * * * RETRACTION FROM JOSEPH LYNCH TO JOHN KNOKE AT 1946 EST ON 3/4/11 * * *  "Event Notification 46521 was conservatively made to ensure that the Eight-Hour Non-Emergency reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 were satisfied pending the evaluation of RCIC System operability.  "On 01/05/11, at 0120 hours the RCIC System was declared inoperable due to uncertainty of RCIC System Operability when the Torus/Suppression Pool Suction Valve (RCIC-26) failed to go fully closed during planned surveillance testing. The valve was restored to the full open position and the valve was declared operable based on capability to meet the required safety function to fully open when RCIC pump suction from the suppression pool is required.  "The apparent cause evaluation concluded that valve failure was the result of high relay contact resistance in the closing control circuit components of the valve breaker. This failure prevented the valve from fully closing but had no affect on capability to open the valve. Surveillance testing verified that capability to open the valve was not affected.  "Corrective action was completed to clean or replace the control circuit relay contacts. Post work testing confirmed capability to open and close the valve. An extent of condition for similar breaker control circuit components was also performed. All relevant technical information is documented in the corrective action system.  "The failure observed did not affect the valve's required safety function and did not impact RCIC System operability. Thus there was no impact on nuclear safety.

On January 10, 2011, the licensee's Radiation Safely Officer reported the identification of five medical events involving permanent implants of I-125 for prostate brachytherapy where the total dose delivered differs from the prescribed dose by 20% or more. The licensee is identifying a medical event of any case where D90<135 Gy or D90>195 Gy for patients who receive seed implants only. [D90 is a recognized value in the regulatory guidelines and means a dose of 90% to the prostate.  Anything outside of the D90 value is considered to be a medical event.] The licensee performed a comprehensive review of all 44 prostate implants performed since August 2003. The licensee's five medical events include one overdose to the prostate and four underdoses to the prostate.  All were patients who received seed implants only. No medical events were identified involving doses to other organs or tissue above 0.50 Sv and 50% more than the expected dose. The licensee has notified the referring physicians and will not be notifying the affected patients per DHS 157.72(1)(e).  "Overdoses (medical event criteria used: D90>195 Gy): 11/13/2008: 199.15 Gy  "Underdoses (medical event criteria used: D90<135 Gy): 2/9/2007: 100.20 Gy;  11/12/2007: 127.34 Gy;  6/16/2008: 130.12 Gy; and  7/13/2010: 116.16 Gy"   * * * UPDATE FROM CHRIS TIMMERMAN TO JOHN KNOKE AT 1212 EST ON 2/1/11 * * *  "This is an update to Event Notification 46528. The licensee recently performed post-implant dosimetry on seven prostate brachytherapy patients whose post-implant dosimetry had never been performed. Evaluation of these seven implants prompted the licensee to report two additional medical events. The medical events involved permanent implants of l-125 for prostate brachytherapy where the total dose delivered to the prostate differs from the prescribed dose by 20% or more. The licensee is in the process of notifying the affected patients and referring physicians.  "Underdoses (medical event criteria used: D90<135 Gy):  8/22/2005: 102.89 Gy; and 5/8/2006: 126.24 Gy;  "DHS will send a special inspection team to determine the root cause(s) of these medical events."

The licensee is retracting an overdose previously reported for a patient who received a permanent prostate implant on November 13, 2008.  During a reactive inspection conducted on February 18, 2011, DHS inspectors identified that post-implant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy implants had not been performed appropriately.  Specifically, the licensee's former physics consultant generated post-plans that were not based on the number of I-125 seeds actually implanted in the patients.  For the patient in question, the original post-plan was based on an implant of 98 seeds; however, only 76 seeds were actually implanted. The licensee's current physicist generated a new post-plan using the correct number of I-125 seeds and observed a corresponding reduction in dose delivered.  The new D90 value for this patient does not meet the licensee's medical event criteria."  WI Event Report ID No.: WI 110002,  2nd Update    Notified FSME(McIntosh) and R3DO (Dickson)|

The CDE systems were shipped in 7 separate packages and confirmation of 7 separate packages was provided which showed the receipt by DLA on 21 May 2010.  An inventory, conducted on 2 February 2011, of the 7 packages at the DLA Distribution Center could only account for 40 of the 52 CDE systems.  The AF Radiation Safety Office contacted the DLA Radiation Safety Office indicating that there was a discrepancy in the number of items receipted compared to the number of items identified as shipped by the unit.  The AF Radiation Safety Office provided the list of serial numbers for the 52 items reportedly shipped which were compared to the current inventory on hand.  It was confirmed that there were 12 serial numbers identified on the shipping list that were not in the current inventory.   An initial search of the designated Radioactive Material Storage area did not locate the items.  "It has been identified that a major issue with the turn-in process was the lack of prior notification of transfer of the CDE from the AF units to the DLA Distribution Site at Red River. A global instruction was provided by the AF PM to ship the material, without the PM providing the turn-in documents. Had the AF PM directed all of the shipment, a document would have been generated and the number of items to be shipped would have been provided to the depot. In the current process, the depot could only act reactively based on available material and paperwork.  "The transfer of CDE systems to the DLA Distribution Centers has been suspended until a more accountable process can be determined.  Additionally the AF will, in the future, direct all shipments directly to Wright Patterson AFB for demilitarization and disposal.  A continued effort to search the hazardous material warehouses for these items will continue."   * * * RETRACTION FROM DAVID COLLINS TO JOE O'HARA AT 1642 ON 03/07/11 * * *   "DLA Distribution is retracting the initial report of potential loss (Event # 46651) as the 12 Chemical Agent Detectors have been accounted for at Pine Bluff Arsenal, another Department of Defense facility and the ultimate destruction site.

Specifically, an error was discovered on valve body drawing V112298, when, during a revision process on Revision B of the drawing, a dimension was omitted that set the depth of the valve shaft bearing bore. This error resulted in a greater possible variation of bearing position in the valve shaft bore. If the error was large, the valve could not be assembled which was not the case for these valves. The valves assembled without incident and passed the operational testing, including a seat leakage test, with no anomalies. In the case that the bearing position error was slight, it is possible that the seal and disc could experience more wear than normal and increased leakage would result. Because these valves are equipped with manual operators, Fisher expects that these valves will not be cycled enough to experience any of the potential problems described above.  This equipment included NPS 4, Class 150, Fisher Type A11 Butterfly Valve Assemblies equipped with Fisher Leverlock Manual Actuators. The NPS 4, A11 is a butterfly valve that uses internal bearings (located on either side of the disc) to provide a radial wear surface for shaft rotation and also serve as a centering system for the disc in the waterway. Centering of the disc is accomplished with a wear surface on the end of the bearings adjacent to the side of the disc. Lateral positioning of the disc is accomplished by controlling the length of the bearings and the depth of the bored holes in the body that accept the bearings.  Fisher has revised the drawings to ensure that this issue is corrected.|

"Four events of unplanned actuations of general containment isolation signals affecting containment Isolation valves in more than one system occurred during planned transfers of power between the normal and alternate power supply for the 3A 480V Shutdown Board.  The first event occurred on January 3, 2011, at 1515 hours Central Standard Time (CST), with Unit 3 in a forced outage and at 0 percent power (0 MWT).  The electrical power to the 3A Reactor Protection System (RPS) was interrupted during the planned transfer of the 3A 480V Shutdown Board from its normal supply to its alternate power supply.  During the transfer, the alternate feeder breaker did not close.  An attempt was made to return to the normal power supply; however, the normal feeder breaker did not initially close but did close on re-attempt. This resulted in the interruption of power to the 3A 480V Shutdown Board, which caused the 3A RPS to de-energize, resulting in a half scram and the actuation of Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) logic Groups 2, 3, 6, and 8, and the initiation of Trains A, B, and C Standby Gas Treatment and Train A Control Room Emergency Ventilation.  "Plant conditions, which require PCIS actuations and the associated system initiations (e.g., low reactor water level, high drywell pressure, abnormal area radiation level, or high area temperature), did not exist; therefore, the actuation was invalid.  The affected equipment responded as designed.  "On January 3, 2011, at approximately 1620 hours CST, Unit 3 Operations personnel restored 3A RPS power and re-aligned affected equipment, as appropriate.  This event was entered in the Corrective Action Program as Problem Evaluation Report (PER) 305070.  "Subsequent related failure to transfer events of the 3A 480V Shutdown Board occurred on January 4, 2011, at 2321 hours, on January 5, 2011, at 0448 hours, and on January 5, 2011, at 0841 hours.  In each event the plant conditions which require PCIS actuations and the associated system initiation did not exist; therefore, the actuations were invalid.  In each of the three subsequent events the affected equipment started and functioned successfully with one exception. During the last event, Main Control Room indication of a Secondary Containment outboard isolation damper closure was indeterminate (i.e., double-lit).  The damper was declared inoperable, and the associated Technical Specification LCO 3.6.4.2 Action was taken.  [A} work order [was] issued to investigate the problem repaired a damper limit switch.

As part of treatment preparation, an MRI was performed on the patient to determine the patient's liver segment volumes.  Liver segment volumes are used in calculating the Y-90 activity needed to deliver the prescribed radiation dose to particular segments of the liver.  The first treatment was to the right lobe and medial segment of the patient's liver and was performed on 12/15/2010.  It proceeded without incident and in accordance with the written directive.    "The Authorized User physician scheduled a second separate treatment to the patient's left lobe to be performed on 3/9/2011.  The Authorized User ordered a 74.4 Gy dose to the left lobe of the liver.  The medical physicist calculated a corresponding dosage of 60.5 mCi of Y-90 to be infused into the left lobe of the liver.  "However, in arriving at the Y-90 activity needed, a medical physicist used the liver segment volumes for the right lobe and medial segment combined instead of that for the left lobe.  The volume of the right lobe and medial segment is much larger than that for the left lobe.  As a result, the Y-90 dosage of 60.5 mCi exceeded what was actually needed to deliver the prescribed dose of 74.4 Gy.  The Y-90 was infused into to the left lobe on 3/9/2011 at approximately 10 [EST].  Based on the Authorized User's reassessment of the left lobe volume, the dose to the left lobe is calculated, post-administration, to be 159.4 Gy.  "The patient was notified of the event on 3/9/2011.  The referring physician was also notified on the morning of 3/10/2011.  The Authorized User physician has concluded that the elevated radiation dose to the patient's liver will not result in permanent medical damage or loss of function.  Upon initial investigation this event appears to possibly be due to a problem in transcription however causes and corrective actions are still being evaluated."  A Medical Event may indicate potential problems in a medical facility's use of radioactive materials.  It does not necessarily result in harm to the patient.|

Diesel Generator B started and re-energized Bus 6.  "At the time of the event, Bus 6 was energized from the Main Auxiliary Transformer (MAT) on backfeed.  The event was caused by opening of substation breaker TA2066 as the result of an error by technicians working In the substation.  "All equipment operated as expected for the voltage restoration to Safeguards Bus 6.  Safeguards Bus 5 remained energized from offsite power through the Tertiary Auxiliary Transformer during the event.  "Spent Fuel Pool Cooling Train A remained In operation during the event.  Spent Fuel Cooling Train B was restarted following restoration of power to Bus 6.  "The loss of the MAT also resulted in the loss of non-safeguards 4160 V Buses 1-4.  In response to the loss of power to Bus 4, the Technical Support Center (TSC) / Station Blackout (SBO) Diesel started and failed to load onto 480 Volt Bus 46.  This resulted in a loss of power to the Technical Support Center.  The loss of power to the TSC is being reported as a loss of Emergency Assessment Capability.  At 1632, the TSC/SBO Diesel Generator tripped due to the failure of the output breaker to close and provide power to its support equipment.  The cause of the failure of the TSC/SBO output breaker to close is unknown at this time."  The licensee is investigating the cause of the breaker being opened and failure of the TSC/SBO diesel to load.  One Spent Fuel Pool cooling train was in service throughout the event and no pool heatup occurred.  The licensee notified the NRC Resident Inspector.|

It was discovered on 3/18/11, by the radiation oncologist covering the SIRS procedure from the day before, that the delivered amount of Y-90 SIRS wasn't 105% above the prescribed dose as intended, but actually 150% above the prescribed dose.  She then brought this error to the attention of the lead medical physicist who was the attending medical physicist responsible for this treatment delivery, for further clarification.  Upon investigation, it was deduced that the medical physicist had not read the patient's SIRS therapy (utilizing Y-90 radioactive isotope) written directive prescription correctly.  A higher than intended dosage was administered to the patient (1.66 GBq).  The correct dosage that was intended to be administered per the written directive was 1.11 GBq.  After calculation was made after the incident it was determined that the intended dose to the liver was 30.72 Gy and the actual dose to the liver was 45.93 Gy.   "Contributing factors to the above error identified by the licensee are as follows: "1. The amount of information presented in the SIRS written directive and the prescribed amount of isotope is hard to discern and is not set apart from all the other numbers presented. "2. The prescribed activity is manually transferred to a secondary worksheet used in Nuclear Medicine to draw the dose to be administered and this secondary activity worksheet is not verified by a secondary party.     "The licensee stated that to prevent such an event from occurring in the future, the SIRS written directive document will be modified to display the prescribed activity more predominantly on the form as well as a space for initializing by a secondary party that the prescribed dose has been transferred/entered properly on the secondary activity worksheet that is used in Nuclear Medicine to draw the dose to be administered.  "The referring physicians as well as the patient have been or are in the process of being notified of this event.  "According to the licensee's Radiation Oncologist and Interventional Radiologist that were asked to consult, this higher dose would slightly increase the patient's risk of radiation-induced liver disease.  The patient, as is standard for all SIRS (Y-90) patients, will receive liver function follow-up testing to track her status."

While opening MSIV's to restore steam to the secondary, a Reactor Trip and Safety Injection (SI) occurred.  The MSIV bypass valves were opened to equalize pressure across the MSIV's.  Steam header pressure dipped when the MSIV for 'C' Steam Generator (S/G) was opened.  The low steamline pressure bistables are rate sensitive and actuated to cause the SI when steam pressure dipped.  Lowest steamline pressure was 1040 psig, the low steam line pressure SI actuates at 615 psig.    "During the SI the PZR [Pressurizer] PORV's cycled approximately 10 times to limit RCS pressure.  When the PORV's opened the 'B' PZR Code Safety Main Control Board (MCB) and plant computer alarm actuated but the actual MCB indication did not change nor does plant response indicate that a PZR Code Safety opened.  This appears to be an indication problem related to the PORV's cycling."  "All equipment functioned as required."  The station electric buses are aligned to normal offsite power.  Decay heat removal is being discharged to the atmospheric relief valves with no indication of primary to secondary leakage.

"2.  During the recovery of the Safety Injection (SI) actuation that occurred 03/19/11 at 04:04 CDT and previously reported on EN 46685, the Safety Injection Signal was reset which blocked any further automatic actuation.  This was directed per the appropriate procedure step.  There is no Technical Specifications allowed condition for both trains of ECCS to be inoperable, therefore the unit entered Tech.

Cell in-leakage through penetrations at 997' 10" MSL would be beyond the capacity of the raw water pumps.  During the preparation of a calculation to demonstrate the validity of this method it was determined that the grid backwash pipe for each grid and the surface sluice penetrate the east wall of the intake structure through an unsealed penetration (a total of 7 penetrations).  The grid backwash line is an 18" pipe passing through a 24" sleeve.

"During a review of historical North Anna NUHOMS dry storage canister (DSC) loading certification documents, a discrepancy was identified.  The NUHOMS Certificate of Compliance 1030 Amendment 0 Technical Specifications include a Figure 2, "Heat Load Zones" which specifies the maximum decay heat load for each of the 32 assembly locations in a DSC.  The figure includes limits for two zone '1b' locations and two zone '1a' locations in the four center locations of the DSC.  The zone '1b' decay heat limit of 0.8 kw is specified for the two 'upper compartments' and zone '1a' decay heat limit of 1.05 kw is specified for the two 'lower compartments' on the figure.  Contrary to this, the loading certifications for 7 of 10 DSCs already loaded at NAPS (North Anna Power Station) were not developed to maintain this orientation when loaded in the horizontal storage module (HSM).  As a result, the DSC zone '1b' heat load limits were exceeded in some cases for these 7 DSCs.  "The heat load limit for all other zones in the DSCs are symmetric, and those assemblies were verified to the correct limit and are unaffected by this error.  In addition the total heat load limit for the sum of the center assemblies was met for all DSCs.  The maximum heat load of any zone '1b' assembly at the time of loading was 0.859 kw, which is slightly higher than the 0.8 kw limit.  The lower heat load of assemblies in the other compartments offset the slightly higher heat load effects, and it is expected that the thermal analysis acceptance criteria would still have been met at the time of loading.  "The decay heat of the assemblies has continued to decrease since their initial loading and it was confirmed that 12 of the 13 assemblies that initially exceeded the 0.8 kw limit currently meet the zone '1b' heat load limits.

"During a review of historical Surry NUHOMS Dry Storage Canister (DSC) loading certification documents, a discrepancy was identified.  The NUHOMS Certificate of Compliance 1030 Amendment 0 Technical Specifications include a Figure 2, 'Heat Load Zones' which specifies the maximum decay heat load for each of the 32 assembly locations in a DSC.  The figure includes limits for two zone '1b' locations and two zone '1a' locations in the four center locations of the DSC.  The zone '1b' decay heat limit of 0.800 kw is specified for the two 'upper compartments' and zone '1a' decay heat limit of 1.05 kw is specified for the two 'lower compartments' on the figure.  Contrary to this, the loading certifications for 6 of 12 DSCs already loaded at Surry were not developed to maintain this orientation when loaded in the horizontal storage module (HSM).  As a result, the DSC zone '1b' heat load limits were exceeded in some cases for these 4 DSCs.  "The heat load limit for all other zones in the DSCs are symmetric, and those assemblies were verified to the correct limit and are unaffected by this error.  In addition the total heat load limit for the sum of the center assemblies was met for all DSCs.  The maximum heat load of any zone '1b' assembly at the time of loading was 0.806 kw, which is slightly higher than the 0.800 kw limit.  The lower heat load of assemblies in the other compartments offset the slightly higher heat load effects, and it is expected that the thermal analysis acceptance criteria would still have been met at the time of loading.  "The decay heat of the assemblies has continued to decrease since their initial loading and all assemblies currently meet the upper central compartment limits.  The affected fuel assemblies are in a safe condition as required by NUHOMS TS 2.2.1.  "The NRC Resident Inspector has been notified of this event."|

While following up on a question from the NRC Resident Inspector, and as a result of an additional question from the Nuclear Oversight organization at Callaway, it was identified that non-safety piping located in the valve room associated with the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) could potentially [make] all four RWST low water level pressure transmitters inoperable in the event of a malfunction of the non-safety piping concurrent with a design-basis loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) and/or following a seismic event. The RWST water level transmitters (which are located in the RWST valve room) perform a safety-related function for the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) by automatically swapping suction sources for the ECCS during a LOCA from the RWST to the containment sumps when a low water level condition is reached in the RWST. These instrument channels are required to be OPERABLE in Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4 per Callaway Technical Specification 3.3.2, 'Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) Instrumentation.'   "The subject non-safety piping delivers steam supplied by the Auxiliary Steam system to (and from) heaters surrounding the RWST for maintaining RWST contents above the minimum required temperature during winter conditions. The piping passes through the RWST valve room containing the noted RWST water level transmitters which were designed only for a mild environment. It has been identified, however, that the non-safety Auxiliary Steam piping constitutes a high energy line and that its failure could create harsh (hot and wet) conditions in the valve room to which the RWST water level instrumentation was not designed.  "Per the Callaway FSAR, where non-safety piping interfaces with safety-related piping or systems, the design must be such that failure of the non-safety piping does not adversely affect the safety function(s) of the interfacing safety-related piping or system (since non-safety piping may be assumed to malfunction in conjunction with a design-basis accident). In this case, and based on a conservative interpretation of the FSAR, if the non-safety piping in the RWST valve room is assumed to malfunction (i.e., break), a failure of the RWST instrumentation could occur, thereby preventing the ECCS suction swap over from occurring as required or assumed for LOCA mitigation.  "This condition required declaring all four RWST water level channels inoperable. In light of recognizing that the RWST water level instruments could be subject to a harsh environment when they were only designed for a mild environment, and could thus fail as a result, this condition represents an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety. With regard to the impact on the required ECCS suction swap over function that requires the RWST water level channels to be operable, the inoperability of all four instrument channels is a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe condition, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, and mitigate the consequences of an accident.  "Upon declaring the RWST water level instrument channels inoperable, TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.3 was entered at time 1432 CDT on 3/31/2011. At 1634 CDT, the Auxiliary Steam system was isolated and depressurized. This removed the energy that could be released from a break in the non-safety piping, thereby restoring Operability for the RWST water level instruments.  "The NRC Senior Resident Inspector was notified."|

These conduits penetrate the south wall of the auxiliary building near the transformers into room 19.  Flooding through the penetrations could have impacted the ability of the station's auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pumps to perform their design accident mitigation functions.    "This eight-hour notification is being made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72 (b)(3)(v).  "The penetrations are at an approximate elevation of 1007 [feet].
